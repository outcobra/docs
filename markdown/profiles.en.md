I had my first contact with software development when I was about twelve years old when someone gifted me a Python 3 book. This made me fall in love with IT and over the years I've been learning new programming languages. I've now mostly settled on Java and Kotlin. Outcobra is a great project for me, because I can utilize modern and exciting technologies. Furthermore, I can also learn more about hardware and networks because I manage the infrastructure for Outcobra.

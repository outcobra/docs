# Who we are

We are a team of three young and passionate developers. Through our common workplace, the Federal Office for Information Technology and Telecommunication, where we are doing our apprenticeship, we were able to meet in the first place. Soon our apprenticeship will be over and we'll be making our way into the real working world.

Our team profits from the many differing interests which complement each other perfectly in Outcobra.

When I was twelve, my uncle gifted me a book about Python 3. That was when it clicked and I started teaching myself to program. Over the years I came in contact with many programming languages, but I've always found programming in Java and now also Kotlin to be really pleasant.

At my workplace, I work with similar technologies which are also present in Outcobra: Spring & Hibernate with ReST endpoints for the UI are there too.

I often spend my free time coding, which you can see from my multitude of small GitHub repositories. In addition, Linux servers have been a great joy for me lately: I own (including Outcobra's) five servers which host my emails, websites, tools and the whole Outcobra infrastructure. I enjoy exchanging knowledge with my colleagues which study systems engineering and experimenting with networks because I want to keep my IT-knowledge as broad as possible.

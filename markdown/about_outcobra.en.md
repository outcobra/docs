## What is Outcobra?
Outcobra is: &quot;A school management tool from students for students.&quot;

It is designed to help you to keep track of all study related things digitally and easily.

Behind Outcobra stand three young developers (in apprenticeship) who wanted to face a new challenge. If you want to know more about us, you can find a short profile here.

## What happened so far

The idea and the first concepts for our tool are originating from a project in professional school. During the school project, we knew that we would want to continue the project afterwards.

With that in mind, we began to set up our development platform. This included the following tasks:

- Choosing technologies
- Creating guidelines
- Setting up continuous integration and deployment

After half a year of work on the school project in a team of four, we decided to continue the project with three people. We began to adapt our workflow to the new conditions. Beside the new role-assignment, we needed a platform to exchange knowledge and work on the project on regular basis. We decided to meet up for a weekly &quot;Coffee and Code&quot;.

Idea by idea and semicolon by semicolon we worked towards the current state…

…and we are happy to keep working on it!
